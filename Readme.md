**IMPORTANT:** The SQL code basically has been merged into a different repository, which now takes care of *two* cancer e-measures, instead of just this one (late stage). Any SQL in the present repo is deprecated.

The R code in the present repo is still of some use, though.

Cancer e-Measure
========

1. Rate of missed red flags (process measure)
2. Rate of cancers diagnosed as an emergency (outcome measure)
3. Rate of cancers diagnosed at advanced stage (outcome measure)

The present repository focuses only on the **advanced stage** e-measure (number 3), for lung and colon cancer. Again, measures 2 and 3 have their SQL code at the repo mentioned above.
